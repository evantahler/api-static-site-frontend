This software is free and open source.  
I want to keep this simple.  Here goes:

I won't be a jerk: 
* Being free software, I will never charge you to use/license/obtain this software. Doing so would make me a jerk.
* You may use this code (and by code I mean anything within in this project) for whatever you want.  Personal use, Educational use, Corporate use, Military use, Para-Military use, and all other uses are OK!  Limiting how you can use something free would make me a jerk.

You won't be a jerk:
* I offer no warrantee on anything, ever.  I've tried to ensure that there are no gaping security holes where using this software might automatically send your credit card information to aliens or erase your entire hard drive, but it might happen.  I'm sorry.  However, I warned you, so you can't sue me.  Suing people over free software would make you a jerk.
* If you find bugs, it would be nice if you let me know so I can fix them.  You don't have to, but not doing so would make you a jerk.
* If you add a cool feature, it would be nice if you passed it back to the project.  You don't have to, but not doing so would make you a jerk.
* If you use this software, you don't have to give me any credit, but it would be nice.

Don't be a jerk.
Enjoy your free software!
